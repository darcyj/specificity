0.1.0.9000 // 2020 DEC 09
  * This changelog was created
  * all functions now refer to species weights as p (perviously w was used sometimes)
  * new strategy for calculating sim specificities (as opposed to emp). uses MUCH less memory. however, this made use of custom null models more difficlt. So the function phy_or_env_spec() was changed such that the actual calculation of specificity is its own function called calculate_spec_and_pval(). in the distant future, a tutorial for "build your own specificity" may be written, maybe. 
  * added function onto2nwk()
  * added function circularize2dist()
  * added cpp funs rao1sp() and raoperms() which replace spec_core()
  * various documentation improvements
  * new visuzlization for combo violins = plot_specs_violin()
0.1.1.9000 // 2020 DEC 11
  * changed srand and std::random_shuffle in C++ code to a new implementation that doesn't make R CMD check angry
  * updated documentation, made examples nicer and made examples actually run on check
  * re-organized extra stuff in package directory into folder "other"
0.1.2.9000 // 2020 JAN 20
  * added Rcpp heder line so that C++11 will be used during compilation by default
  * added log for what package versions were used during a build in other/  
0.1.3.9000 // 2020 JAN 21

  * added chunking for sim RAO computation
  * parallelized
