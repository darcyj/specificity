\usage{
wpd_table(m, s_phylo, nested_set, metric = "Hp", ncores = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{matrix of species observation vectors (s). See s argument of wpd().}

\item{s_phylo}{phylo object. Tree containing all unique names in s as tips.
Must not contain duplicate tip labels.}

\item{nested_set}{matrix. The output of make_nested_set(s_phylo). If not
provided, will be calculated on the fly. Precalculation only provides speedup
with very large trees (default: NULL).}

\item{metric}{character. Abbreviated name of desired tree-based phylogenetic
diversity metric. Available metrics are:
\describe{
  \item{Hp:}{
    Phylogenetic Entropy. Insensitive to 0 weights, cannot increase with removal
    of taxa. Allen et al. 2009.
  }
  \item{WF:}{
    Weighted Faith's PD. Sensitive to 0 weights, i.e. a clade that was heavily
    sampled but has lots of zeroes will cause its sister clades to be
    underrepresented. Swenson 2014.
  }
  \item{PD:}{
    Original Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity. Unweighted. Simply a sum of branch-
    lengths in your tree (but only for taxa in s). Faith 1992.
  }
}}
}
\value{
multiple WPD or PD values, one for each column of m.
}
\description{
Calculates phylogenetic entropy (Hp) for each column vector s of species
observations within matrix m, weighted by the frequency of each species within
s. Can also calculate Faith's PD.
