0.1.0.9000 // 2020 DEC 09
  * This changelog was created
  * all functions now refer to species weights as p (perviously w was used sometimes)
  * new strategy for calculating sim specificities (as opposed to emp). uses MUCH
    less memory. however, this made use of custom null models more difficlt. So the
    function phy_or_env_spec() was changed such that the actual calculation of 
    specificity is its own function called calculate_spec_and_pval(). in the distant
    future, a tutorial for "build your own specificity" may be written, maybe. 
  * added function onto2nwk()
  * added function circularize2dist()
  * added cpp funs rao1sp() and raoperms() which replace spec_core()
  * various documentation improvements
  * new visuzlization for combo violins = plot_specs_violin()
