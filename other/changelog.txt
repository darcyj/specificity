0.1.0.9000 // 2020 DEC 09
  * This changelog was created
  * all functions now refer to species weights as p (perviously w was used sometimes)
  * new strategy for calculating sim specificities (as opposed to emp). uses MUCH less memory. however, this made use of custom null models more difficlt. So the function phy_or_env_spec() was changed such that the actual calculation of specificity is its own function called calculate_spec_and_pval(). in the distant future, a tutorial for "build your own specificity" may be written, maybe. 
  * added function onto2nwk()
  * added function circularize2dist()
  * added cpp funs rao1sp() and raoperms() which replace spec_core()
  * various documentation improvements
  * new visuzlization for combo violins = plot_specs_violin()
0.1.1.9000 // 2020 DEC 11
  * changed srand and std::random_shuffle in C++ code to a new implementation that doesn't make R CMD check angry
  * updated documentation, made examples nicer and made examples actually run on check
  * re-organized extra stuff in package directory into folder "other"
0.1.2.9000 // 2021 JAN 20
  * added Rcpp heder line so that C++11 will be used during compilation by default
  * added log for what package versions were used during a build in other/  
0.1.3.9000 // 2021 JAN 21
  * reverted C++11 header because it isn't necessary and actually slowed stuff down
  * added chunking for sim RAO computation
0.1.3.9000 // 2021 FEB 08
  * fixed bug in plot_specs_violin() where it wouldn't work unless >3 significant features
  * added note in update script to update this changelog
0.1.5.9000 // 2021 MAY 10
  * changed phy_or_env_spec and calculate_spec_and_pval "index" mode. Now, GA is used to
    calcualte max rqe value. old index mode is now "index_rough". 
  * added function get_ga_defaults()
0.1.6.9000 // 2021 MAY 17
  * added "index_fast" option to phy_or_env_spec's denom argument. This is a compromise
    between "index_full" (use GA on everything) and "rough" (above). 
  * uppdates to C++ functions to improve efficiency
  * bug fix in plot_specs_violin
0.1.7.9000 // 2021 MAY 19
  * update vignette
  * remove old "sim" functions that are no longer used
0.1.8.9000 // 2021 MAY 24
  * phy_or_env_spec: remove maxint check, instead check for ints in abunds_mat and
    change to doubles if present
0.1.9.9000 // 2021 JUL 22
  * new function - aggregate_specs_list turns data from specs list and metadata into "long" or
    "wide" format data, for ggplot etc
  * added taxonomy to endophyte example data set for use with aggregate_specs_list()
  * removed "index_fast" and "index_rough" from denom_type options of phy_or_env_spec(). It
    turned out that the approximation upon which those options were based was critically
    flawed. 
  * added documentation for previously undocumented "sim_center" denom_type option for 
    phy_or_env_spec(). it serves as a new "quick and dirty" option for examples and for users
    who don't care about species with weaker specificity than expected by chance. 
  * removed popsize argument from rao_genetic_max; population initialization is now specified
    using popsize_swap and popsize_perm, each with default 150. 
  * added option to make rao_genetic_max have stochastic swap rate using the new swap_freq
    argument. This is a required argument and may break previous code using rao_genetic_max.
  * general improvements to documentation
  * updated vignette with a ggplot example
