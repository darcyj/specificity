\format{
A list containing 3 objects:
\describe{
  \item{otutable:}{
    data.frame object where each row is a sample and each column is a
    fungal OTU (actually ASV from DADA2). Rownames are sample IDs.
  }
  \item{metadata:}{
    data.frame object containing environmental metadata for samples in
    otutable. SampleID column of metadata matches rownames of otutable.
  }
  \item{supertree:}{
    Phylogenetic tree containing all host plant genera in PlantGenus
    column of metadata.
  }
