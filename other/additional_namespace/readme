This folder contains additional lines for the NAMESPACE of this R package.
Those lines are not automatically added by document(), but are important
for the package to pass R CMD check (note: the package WILL WORK if built
without those lines...). 

These lines are added to NAMESPACE when update_r_package.r is run, which
should be done line-by-line in interactive mode whenever changes are made
to the package.
