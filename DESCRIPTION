Description: The purpose of this package is to calculate phylogenetic and environmental specificity of species. This software can be used to analyze specificity of microbes to hosts or to environment, but there is no reason that this software wouldn't work with other feature types (macroorganisms, rocks, pizza toppings) as well.
